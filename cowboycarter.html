            <h1>beyoncé - cowboy carter [album]</h1>
            <p>firstly. i am a COMMITTED student i'll tell you... cowboy carter was released on a local basis so it was
                out in new zealand like a day before it was out in canada. but i had a TOK assignment i was so focused
                on to the point that i didn't listen to the bey album until it was actually out... talk about commitment
            </p>
            <p>i love this album, it's really fantastic and i feel like it will translate really well into a live
                setting (esp songs like <i>ya ya</i> and <i>bodyguard</i>). but anyways, on release night of this album
                it was a super
                exciting time. i listened to it alongside a good friend of mine and we were spamming eachother's
                instagram dms the whole listening experience (and this is still the main source of our messages)</p>
            <p>like i'm literally writing my math IA on the cowboy carter vinyl and determining how far the stylus
                travels (but i'm enjoying it!!), but anyways i just really love the song, some standouts are
                <i>ameriican requiem</i>, <i>16 carriages</i>, <i>ameriican requiem</i>, <i>bodyguard</i>, <i>ii most
                    wanted</i>, <i>ya ya</i>, and <i>amen</i>... although those are not necessarily the BEST songs -
                this album is just really fantastic all around. it's 27 tracks but like five are interludes, but beyonce
                really showed she could master any genre. i love how she included this quote in the album:
            </p>
            <blockquote>genres are a funny little concept, aren't they? / in theory, they have a simple definition
                that's easy to understand / but in practice, some may feel confined</blockquote>
            <p>this really feels like the thesis of the whole album, as her instagram post said, this isn't a country
                album, it's a beyonce album</p>

            <h5>short explanation</h5>
            <p>such a great standout from the album... going from the boots are made for walking sample to the vocals,
                this is just a fun song!</p>
