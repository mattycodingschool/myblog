            <h1>my fav songs right now (11/27/25)</h1>
            <p>hi! it's been quite some time... i don't think i've updated this website around a year and a half... i'm 18 now (almost 19), i'm at brown (bye ucc :( ), and i'm not sure why i'm suddenly updating this (it's recently come up in like five unrelated conversations though so maybe i'm inspired).</p>
            <p>anyways, today's blog? post is really repeating things i'm sure i've written here before, but i've never made a solid list of my genuine FAVOURITE songs. obviously, this changes a lot, but i just want to record down somewhere the four songs that i've never gotten tired of.</p>
            <p>as always, if any of these connect with you, let me know! (and it makes me want to keep writing these little posts!!)</p>
            <h3>song 1: florence & the machine - the end of love</h3>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1tpkN6z0Zd3wphAd3DASDX?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>this is a song that has stuck with me for a very long time (i've mentioned it <a href="../writings/writings.html">here</a>). i love the piano (i am currently learning the chords and can hopefully play it soon...). i wrote a very personal paper last year for an english class and this song was playing on repeat while i was making it (perhaps i'd be willing to share if you send a message!), but since then the song has held such a deep connection to me. i especially love the bridge.</p>
            <h3>song 2: fka twigs - meta angel</h3>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6EeuY84I1Q3UJvpPN6iSzw?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>this may be the only song on the list that i haven't mentioned on this website before... i've mentioned twigs but meta angel is (by far) my favourite song of hers. the intro is so cute, but the song progresses (and becomes MUCH better) after. interestingly, i was first attracted to this song because of this one (more emotional) part in the middle (starting with the lines "throw in the fire, ego in the fire"), but my favourite part of the song now is simply the main choruses ("i got voices in my head").</p>
            <h3>song 3: fiona apple - i want you to love me</h3>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/73SBAGI4fPFm4VkB3NjXq8?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>i guess i really like singers beginning with the letter f... i don't think this is much of a shocker if you know me. i love fiona apple, and i want you to love me was the first song of hers i've ever listened to and it is still my favourite of hers. i love the part beginning with "i move with the trees in the breeze"... something about that really encapsulates this outlook i have on life, and maybe that's why i love the song so much. continuing off of the piano trend, i also learned how to play this one on the piano... i'm not very good at it but i can get the intro out.</p>
            <h3>song 4: ethel cain - sun bleached flies</h3>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6fKIyDJHZ9m84jRhSmpuwS?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>the final song i'm going to go into detail about is another one i just really connect with. i realize that the four songs i've written about all have parts where they feel "loud" i guess? there's either loud instruments or vocals or something, but all of the songs make it feel like something is clawing at you which i really love. sun bleached flies is no exception, it's such a masterful song and i've written much more about the album in <a href="../music/preachersdaughter.html"></a>, the song is lovely. also (kinda) unrelated but another song that would fit on this list in terms of how it makes me feel is rocket's tail by kate bush.</h3>
