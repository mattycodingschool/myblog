            <h1>coachella (youtube livestreams)</h1>
            <p>everyone's favourite event of the year has come once again - coachella! of course, i am not going to
                coachella, but i am watching it from home and since week 1 has ended, id love to share my thoughts so
                far!</p>
            <h2>friday:</h2>
            <p>i started by watching chappell roan, she sounded amazing and it was super cool seeing her on stage, she
                has so much potential to become a huge artist (i mean look at the crowd during hottogo), and im really
                excited to see where she'll end up. i saw a bit of sabrina/tinashe, and then flipped through chloe and
                peggy gou. peggy was a pretty cool set - i really liked the djing. according to stuff online hatsune
                miku was going to be this cool hologram that i was excited to see, but she ended up being a tv screen
                and i ended up closing the livestream. finally, of course, we have headliner lana del rey. ah its
                honestly surreal seeing her with such a big platform but her music is really built for smaller, more
                intimate crowds. i really want to see what she pulls out week 2 because maybe being more comfortable w/
                coachella now will allow her to really put EVERYTHING into it, but i don't think she was as bad as some
                say.</p>
            <h2>saturday:</h2>
            <p>RAYE was amazing! she has so much potential obviously and will become a star. her performance was just
                really incredible and its interesting to see how her music appeals to people into all different types of
                music tbh. vampire weekend was also great (shoutout to my dad for always playing them in the car when i
                was younger), and also shoutout to him for telling me to listen to the last dinner party who sounded
                great! when jon batiste brought out willow it was a really cool performance, and then (may i say
                shockingly), ice spice delivered one of the best performances of the night? like HELLO im shocked too
                but she was able to get this huge crowed all riled up singing her songs and i guess its proof that to be
                successful at coachella really means being able to engage with the audience, hoping this happens more
                next week. speaking about crowd engagement - no doubt was AMAZING and it was so cool to hear their
                songs, le sserafim was interesting i think they must have had mic issues, and tyler the creater was a
                really nice headlining performance</p>
            <h2>sunday:</h2>
            <p>YG marley was a pretty nice performance, but the highlight was bringing out lauryn hill who is just
                amazing. renee rapp was pretty similar, but she brought out kesha and they changed the lyrics to tik tok
                a bit (relevantly), victoria monet sounded great as always, and doja cat had a pretty nice performance.
                overall, sunday was a lot <i>less</i> than all the other days but i mean im watching it for free on
                youtube so who am i to complain</p>

            <h5>short explanation</h5>
            <p>something not mentioned - this song got me REALLY looking into the origins of coachella and i found daft
                punk's tremendous 2006 performance and this song (while at a different festival/concert) was similar to
                how they opened! it's such a great song and i cant believe i haven't listened to this sooner</p>
