            <h1>the worst cover of all time.</h1>
            <p>close your eyes and imagine, (wait dont actually you need to read this), it's summer 2014, one of those
                despicable me movies just came out, solange and jay-z went on that elevator, and, of course, bang bang
                by jessie j, ariana grande, and nicki minaj was released.</p>
            <p>what an incredibly catchy song, it's great! there is a music video in which the three songstresses were
                not green-screened in (this will be relevant later - just remember that all 3 were TOGETHER with
                photography equipment)</p>
            <p>and, im not sure if it was the record label or them, but they decide to release this MONSTROSITY as the
                single cover.. ok are you ready for it</p>
            <p>its bad.</p>
            <div id="image-container">
                <div id="placeholder" onclick="showImage()">
                    <p id="white">click me</p>

                    alt="bang bang oH MY GOD">
            </div>
            <p>LIKE?? im sorry. why what who went into this.. YOU HAD THEM ALL TOGETHER it would have taken literally 30
                seconds to take an iphone photo and it would look better than... this</p>
            <p>why is ariana orange? why are all their faces blurred like they just learned how to use photoshop??? ITS
                TERRIBLE</p>
            <p>like its to the point where fans have created like hundreds of alternate covers... all of which are
                better than this (you can google bang bang fanmade cover).</p>
