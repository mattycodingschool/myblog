            <h1>jazmine vs kenzo</h1>
            <p>so i dont know how many of you are on twitter but if you are.. be prepared for this... SO as some
                context, a fragment of twitter (im never going to call it "X") is called "stan twitter".. its an
                interesting subculture containing obsessive fans of practically every artist. there's fanbases, you
                know, the swifties (taylor), the arianators (ariana), the beyhive (you should know this one.)... this
                will focus on two main fanbases, the barbz (nicki) and well idk if dua lipa fans have names so im gonna
                make one up - dulapeeps (@wendy williams)</p>
            <p>SO! dramas been going on for weeks specifically between the barbz and the hotties (megan thee stallion)
                due to an ongoing feud between the two artists. ANYWAYS, kenzo is a dulapeep, and jazmine is a barb,
                they had been beefing for quite some time online and kenzo posted a video of him outside his house,
                urging twitter (as a joke, i presume) to come to his house</p>
            <p>jazmine did just this.</p>
            <p>jazmine took a flight to kenzo's house, took photos outside of it, causing kenzo and his father to go
                outside and call the cops. i don't know if i did this justice but oh my god this will not work without
                videos to show the absurdity of this</p>

                        home
                        and encouraging stan twitter to come to his house. <a

            <p>of course, in twitter fashion, this went viral, causing some stans of other artists to make some jokes...

            <p>for context, the song "the light is coming" by ariana grande features nicki minaj, and the video is
                actually surprisingly similar to this fan's remake!</p>
            <p>so, that concludes this lesson!</p>
