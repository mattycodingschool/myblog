            <h1>happiness</h1>
            <p>i haven't really taken the time to reflect on my life in quite a bit, but i've come to the realization
                that i'm feeling really happy
            </p>
            <p>like i don't know, nothing specific about my life is <i>screaming</i> "you're the happiest person in the
                world right now" (im not), and nothing specifically has happened recently that has prompted me to
                reflect on my life/feel so grateful, but i've recently realized that i'm in a place i didn't always
                think i'd end up in.</p>
            <p>i think this realization that i <i>am</i> happy (this is embarassing tbqh) came when i was listening to
                the album solar power by lorde for the first time in quite a while. i remember i wasn't the biggest fan
                of it when it came out, it was so different from the rest of her work.</p>
            <p>but in that moment, for the first time, i related to that album. and i guess the reason why i was so
                apathetic to it was because i didn't feel any connection with it. but now i do! and that's pretty
                beautiful to me.</p>
            <p>and i keep having this recurring "what if"-esque thought just about my younger self and if i knew that
                i'd end up where i am today. because i'm not in some incredibly always beautiful place, but i'm doing so
                much better than i ever have before, i'm in a place i never thought i'd end up in</p>
            <p>and i almost wish i could tell my younger self thatâ€”this idea that life <i>will</i> get better. i mean
                people would tell that to me all the time, but i never believed it. and again, it wasn't some sudden
                thing that made me realize that life is good, but just reflecting on the past few months, i've realized
                how lucky i am in life, and it's really helped me to stay on the brighter side.</p>
            <p>i <i>really</i> hope this feeling will continue. i don't feel this sense of dread that my happiness will
                one day disappear (hopefully it's here to stay), and that just makes me feel really, really good</p>
            <p>so, like solar power (and again, i feel so embarassed that <i>this</i> album is the one that's giving me
                this recognition, but whatever), i guess the sun came around, i let the bliss begin. i won't find
                nirvana, but i'll continue taking it bit by bit, and i don't think i can ask for more than that.</p>
            <p>anyways, i think the best way to tl;dr this whole thing, is just to say... i'm finally at a place in my
                life where i can understand solar power by lorde, and that's crazy to me.</p>
