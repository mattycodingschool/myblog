            <h1>shower meditation</h1>
            <p>any time i take a shower, i always play music in it. it's the perfect little acoustic chamber and really
                elevates an already peaceful experience.
            </p>
            <p>but i recently started doing something which has brought me even more peace... every so often, when i
                shower, i'll stay in it at the end. i'll sit down, having turned off the water and queued up a playlist
                of certain ethereal-type
                songs (cocteau twins, mazzy star, etc), i'll close my eyes and just... do nothing.</p>
            <p>ok, that sounds really boring but i've never been the type of person able to fully clear their mind. i
                always have <i>something</i> to think about, and i remember wishing as a kid that i could, even for ten
                minutes, be able to think about nothing.</p>
            <p>and for me (at least) that is MUCH easier said than done. it's something i still can't really do. but,
                for however long i sit in that shower, my body is... somehow able to turn off. i become one with my
                surroundings. </p>
            <p>this may sound like a really weird random thing to do, but, it works for me. it brings me so much bliss
                and heaven that i wish i had done this years ago. but i'm so glad to have started it now!</p>
            <p>i titled this article "shower meditation" because this <i>does</i> feel like some form of meditation to
                me. even though i may be blasting music (which might interfere with my senses), i'm able to sit down,
                eyes closed, clear mind, at peace. it's something i haven't really experienced before.</p>
            <p>anyways, i wrote a teensy bit more about it in <a href="../writings/showermeditationpoem.html">this
                    little poem</a>, but yeah! just wanted to write about
                this a tiny bit and hopefully share it because i would recommend to anyone.. it's truly so blissful.</p>
