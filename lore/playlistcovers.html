            <h1>playlist covers</h1>
            <p>ok, this is a bit of an unserious website entry but i'm quite proud and thankfully (shoutout to angelo)
                for this, and i must share it somewhere.</p>
            <p>after such a long time of having a bland, boring apple music profile (sorry spotify users), i've finally
                CUSTOMIZED my profile and added playlists and it's so fun, like the vibe of each playlist/cover is too
                real</p>
            <p>i think im making a mountain out of a molehill but i don't care i'm so proud of these little cute covers
                with their little vibe and i think that makes them the perfect addition to the "lore" section of this
                website... idk i don't need to justify my additions to MY website</p>
            <img id="playlistcovers" src="../photos/playlistcovers.png" alt="normal heart" width="510">
            <p>i don't even know what i'm getting at to be quite honest, i just love the vibe... special shoutout to my
                <a href="https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/ethereal/pl.u-WabZ6DaHdBKllZp" target="_blank">ethereal
                    playlist</a>, it's my favourite thing and maybe my fav genre (if that's what you'd call it?) of
                music, like ugh just lying down, hearing nothing but the music that makes you feel like you're ascending
                towards the heavens is just so beautiful
