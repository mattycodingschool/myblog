            <h1>bunk bed fall</h1>
            <p><i>i am so happy the subject of this story gave me his consent for this because this is a fun one..</i>
            </p>
            <p>so, it's grade 3, and our class is going on an overnight (i think) field trip to this awesome place,
                literally my favourite place ever idk</p>
            <p>i forget what time of day it was, or whatever, but we were all playing tag in the building, now it was
                honestly super fun, this is back when i was in my athletic era (she's a runner she's a track star), so
                you know i wasn't getting tagged.</p>
            <p>my friend, however, was not as lucky.</p>
            <p>he got tagged, but that's ok, he could tag somebody else. so he went to the next bunk bed</p>
            <p>and then to the next bunk bed</p>
            <p>and then jumped to the next</p>
            <p>and then... there was silence</p>
            <p>*thud*</p>
            <p>silence again</p>
            <p>AHHHHHHHHHH</p>
            <p>he had fallen off the bunk bed flat on his back. oh my was that a moment</p>
            <p>although i will tell you, that kid was dedicated because after lying there, or maybe when one of us went
                up to check on his, he tagged them. so i guess he ended up winning (but at what cost?)</p>
