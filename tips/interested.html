            <h1>stay interested</h1>
            <p>ok this is something im sure everyone's teachers has regurgitated like a million times but as a product
                of this, i can speak to how valuable it is: do school work on stuff that genuinely interests you, you
                will do better.</p>
            <p>i don't know, i think it's a subconscious thing that actually makes you want to finish the
                project/assignment that you're doing, and i have proof! last year, i wrote an english essay about
                beyoncé, a civics article about the TTC, and a math project on global warming (altho i think everyone
                had to do that last one but I WAS INTERESTED)</p>
            <p>this year, i've gotten worse. the IB examiners will be mad at me. my math IA is calculating the length of
                a beyonce vinyl record, my first science lab was on the HIV pandemic, tok first drafts were on
                renaissance tour (couldnt do it), a dress i made (could do it!), an ethel cain laptop sticker (didnt do
                it), and of course my (mock) essay was on bird periods and zoology! honestly i've gotten those tok stuff
                back by now and WHATEVER (lol) but like i'm proud of myself for at least commiting to the stuff i found
                interested in, and it surely made me want to spend... however long i spent... writing it.</p>
            <p>but thats not all! my ee is on janelle monáe's afrofuturism, my econ project is on ticketmaster and its
                monopoly, i somehow brought eurovision into my french oral (and then also now want to talk about daft
                punk and michel foucault), i wrote about myself (IM INTERESTED IN MYSELF - also the whole class did i'm
                not THAT narcissistic) for english, and one of my
                favourite things we've done in chem this year was an investigation into a plane crash (shoutout to
                matthew my fellow detective)</p>
            <p>the point of this is—DO WHAT YOU ENJOY—not only will you look back on assignments not feeling like you
                wasted your time, but you'll also just.. have fun doing them, which WILL translate into a better outcome
                (not necessarily mark wise [but hopefully], but 100% in terms of reflection and enjoyment [which imo is
                important too!!])</p>

            <p>another piece of advice! for some fun (if you're bored), search up azealia banks and your birthday and
                find out what she did that day (like an individual florida man or something..)</p>
