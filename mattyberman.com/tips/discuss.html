            <h1>what to do when you finish a test/assignment</h1>
            <p>this is a skill i've been trying to grow this year and it's surprisingly not as difficult as you think,
                just requires you to be intentional. okay! you ready for it, maybe this is just me but it WORKS. when
                you finish a test or an assignment, don't think about it. just don't</p>
            <p>maybe this is just my mind but OH MY GOD every time i look back to a test i can only ever think about
                what went wrong. i'm sorry but i don't think i've had a single conversation post-test that i've come out
                of actually feeling better, because it's fully this negative news spiral. eg, i tell my friend the test
                waas "ok", they tell their friend "matty only found it ok", they tell their friend "oh my god this test
                is hard", ETC. or, two groups of the class form where half the kids got answer a, half got answer b,
                both sides end up trying to convince the other but both end up thinking they were wrong!</p>
            <p>you already did the test, there's NOTHING you can do to improve now, all you can do is move along to the
                next thing, dont spend time worrying about the past. you know what this actually goes right into <a
                    href="../anecdotes/liveinthemoment.html">an anecdote</a> that i wrote a bit about, but it's that, if
                you felt the test went well, the more you think about it the worse your perception of it will be, just
                move on and wait until you get that test back</p>
            <p>oh and i'm feeling so kind, extra tip ^^ dont beg your teacher to get the test back it never works.</p>
