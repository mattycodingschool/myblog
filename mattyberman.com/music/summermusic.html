            <h1>summer music</h1>
            <p>it's been quite a while since i've posted anything on the website, and what better way to come back then
                with music that's captivated me over the summer... the rules for this post is that i can only include
                songs i've only discovered this summer (well duh), BUT also, all music has to be by artists that i've
                never listened to
                before</p>
            <p><i>cocteau twins - cherry-coloured funk</i> oh my god how did i miss this... cocteau twins as a whole is
                an incredible band, i've been continuously searching for songs with that "ethereal" sound (similar to
                televangelism by ethel, home with you by fka twigs) and i've finally found it here. the whole album
                "heaven or las vegas" is so fantastic (i mean that title alone...), and i'm super excited to continue
                listening to the band! in terms of this specific song... just wow. apparently the singers (singer?) of
                cocteau twins doesn't actually say any real phrases and its a bunch of words in a random order, but it
                feels so powerful lyrics aren't necessary. i love it.</p>

            <p><i>tame impala - let it happen</i> continuing off of cocteau twins' etherealness, this song just does it
                too for me. as somebody who loves rihanna's "ANTI", i had no clue that the song "same ol' mistakes" was
                a cover, and listening to the original on this tame impala album was just so shocking/random i loved it.
                let it happen is truly a great song and idk how i never got into it (or tame impala as a whole) back
                when it was trending on tiktok
                or whatever... but i'm happy i've finally found it</p>

            <p><i>kavinsky - nightcall</i> thank you so much paris olympics for introducing me to this, just a great
                all-around song, there's something so beautiful about the chorus especially</p>

            <p><i>azealia banks - atm jam (kaytranada remix)</i> ok, maybe this is cheating because i've listened to
                quite a bit azealia before, but i've never heard kaytranada's music. this remix is just INCREDIBLE and i
                love it so much, the synths feel so lovely to hear and it's a fun experience... also bonus points - for
                the first time ever on mattyberman.com... we have a soundcloud link instead of spotify, yay! also
                shoutout as a whole to kaytranada's boiler room, incredible!!</p>
