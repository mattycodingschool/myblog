            <h1>sophie - product [album]</h1>
            <p>i think i'd be doing a major disservice to myself if i didn't talk about SOPHIE - an artist who has
                changed electronic music (specifically "hyperpop") and will have resounding effects on the future of
                music, and we can already see this happening if you look at music from the past five years but... i
                digress</p>
            <p>product is sophie's first full album, spanning eight songs, it's an incredible debut. the first song,
                <i>bipp</i> is a perfect way to open the album, if you don't know sophie's music, its incredibly
                metallic (not like death metal, but as in every beat sounds like a piece of metal is being hit with a
                drumstick or something), sophie was very unconventional, and this song feels like it blends that gap of
                familiar vs unfamiliar
            </p>
            <p>transitioning into songs like <i>lemonade</i>, which was (somehow) featured in a mcdonalds commercial?
                just reflects this surrealist element present in all of sophie's works. the next song, <i>hard</i> is
                one of the highlights of this album, i spoke about that "metallic" element of sophie's music, but this
                song really showcases it. sophie was a master at creating synths, and it really shows here.
            </p>
            <p>the song <i>l.o.v.e.</i> is a jumpscare to be honest, the first time i played it i thought my airpods
                were broken, but who knows! and then finally the last song <i>just like we never said goodbye</i> is
                maybe my favourite sophie song of all time - something about it feels so nostalgic and unique, and it
                really feels like i'm reuniting with a friend or something. nothing about the song is even <i>that</i>
                out there, like it isn't sophie's most experimental or anything, but it just resonates with me a lot</p>
            <p>anyways, highlights from this album are <i>bipp</i>, <i>hard</i>, and <i>just like we never said
                    goodbye</i>. if you have a listen, please share me your thoughts because i'm genuinely incredibly
                curious, it is VERY experimental and VERY out there, but if it hits, <i>it hits</i>.</p>

            <p>even though <i>just like we never said goodbye</i> is my favourite song on this album, HARD is the
                perfect display of what makes sophie's music so unique</p>
