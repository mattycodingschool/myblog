            <h1>quick kate bush thoughts</h1>
            <p>im in a kate bush mood and thought it might be nice to go through her discography and name a few songs i
                truly love</p>
            <p><i>wuthering heights</i> is (i think) the song that made me fall in love with her, i wish i could listen
                to this song for the first time because of the like etherealness i felt listening to it, and then
                hearing her voice come in and being fully SHOCKED, and then being like "oh my god, who is this" (and fun
                fact, this was before she went viral so id like to say i knew her !!)</p>
            <p><i>oh to be in love</i> credits to my cousin for telling me to listen to this one, and yes, this is one
                of the few love songs (maybe also <i>hot knife</i> by fiona apple) that actually feels like a love song,
                the instrumentals and her voice feels so warm and welcoming and its just awesome</p>
            <p><i>don't push your foot on the heartbreak</i> is the standout from her album lionheart, it's just a nice
                fun song that feels motivational-esque even if the song is nowhere near that at all</p>
            <p><i>babooshka</i> i mean... come on. this song is amazing and it makes me feel like the villain but at the
                same time so powerful? i think this is when kate started using the fairlight which becomes a staple on
                later albums, but her vocal layering here combined with the plot is just amazing and it's a really cool
                song when you get to the chorus</p>
            <p><i>sat in your lap</i> the first song on the dreaming but holy this album is just amazing. it's
                experimental and innovative and feels so new even today, like i wish more music sounded like this and
                its just so ahead of her time? like even by today's standards, and im really interested to see what
                happens to this album as a whole in the future - i think it deserves more recognition for the trend it
                has continued to push</p>
            <p><i>suspended in gaffa</i> this is kate's lyricism at its best (along with its sound of course), i love
                her metaphor here of gaffer tape and just how she navigates the song through her use of the fairlight
                but then making the production feel like another plotline in the song itself (if that makes sense? idk
                if it does), it just feels very cohesive</p>
            <p><i>cloudbusting</i> this song is the reason that (at one point) i was going to use the cloudbuster
                machine as my tok real world example (never ended up happening), but this song is just... amazing. it's
                kate making conventional music but still pushing boundaries and the music video for this is her best</p>
            <p><i>waking the witch</i> if i could choose one song from the ninth wave, it's this. this is when kate is a
                storyteller (for context, the ninth wave is side B of hounds of love and is a concept album about
                drowning),
                but the voice modulation in this, kate sounding like a demon, the spectators of the witch trial, it's
                crazy and a must listen</p>
            <p><i>rockets tail</i> and <i>this woman's work</i> ik these are two songs but they're right beside
                eachother and are just perfect. rocket's tail sounds amazing with this bulgarian choir she brings in
                (who TREMENDOUSLY elevate the song), and then this woman's work may just be kate's best song, or at
                least the song that feels like the culmination of her career or some deeper meaning. it's beautiful
                (also shoutout to <i>deeper understanding</i> from this album as well)</p>
            <p><i>rubberband girl</i> probably the highlight of her album the red shoes, it's a really fun song</p>
            <p><i>king of the mountain</i> is from side A of aerial and is just this super relaxing song, or this
                feeling of overcoming some external pressure, and she just crafts it really well and was a great song to
                pick as her return to music after like twelve years</p>
            <p><i>sunset</i>, <i>nocturn</i>, and <i>aerial</i>, all from side B of aerial. side B, also known as "an
                endless sky of honey" is (like the ninth wave) a concept album, but this is about the progress of a
                summer
                day. these three songs are the highlights of the story, and i really just enjoy them!

            <h5>short explanation</h5>
            <p>not sure why im choosing this out of all the songs ive mentioned, it's not my favourite of them but is
                still amazing and very much just fits my vibe rn (also i mentioned tok at one point in this page and the
                way she talks about knowledge lowkey feels tok-esque)</p>
