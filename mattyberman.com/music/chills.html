            <h1>chilling moments in music</h1>
            <p>you know those moments in songs that just feel crazy - whether it's a beat coming in, a beautiful lyric,
                the perfect harmony? i thought it might be nice to compile some here.. maybe this will be an updated
                list (although knowing myself.. idk), but here are some songs and timestamps in them that have
                chill-inducing moments.</p>
            <p><i>lorde - oceanic feeling - 5:38</i> i'm not the biggest fan of this song, its a good song—don't get me
                wrong—but i don't find myself putting it on first thing. HOWEVER, this outro is incredibly beautiful to
                me. the softness of her voice, the almost-acoustic feeling, and that almost nostalgic/sentimental
                goodbye all make me a bit reflective.</p>

                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p><i>beyoncé - heated - 3:01</i> i think anyone who has heard this song knows exactly what moment i'm
                talking about. i mean listening to it now i don't feel those chills, but the first time i heard it, i
                was shocked. such an authentic celebration of ballroom.</p>

            <p><i>fka twigs - home with you - 2:46</i> an increadibly beautiful climax of the song. the harmonies, the
                instrumental, everything just works. it's this emotional, genuine moment.</p>

            <p><i>caroline polachek - billions - 3:37</i> once again, just a fantastic moment at the end of a fantastic
                song. hearing this children's choir (i think) come in during this song was shocking, but it really
                elevates the song.</p>

            <p><i>carly rae jepsen - run away with me - 1:02</i> i feel like in the title i said something about a beat
                coming in... and none of the songs have actually been that yet so here is maybe the best beat drop (if
                that's what it's called) of all time. there's a really nice <a

                dissecting it. but yeah, this isnt even that crazy just so sonically pleasing.</p>

            <h5>short explanation</h5>
            <p>the album was released yesterday! go listen!<br><br>also side note - i ordered a vinyl for this album but
                i
                guess they weren't selling well because they've now added a 6 foot by 4 foot poster (for free) along
                with
                it.. of just the album cover.. which is... literally nothing.. except for this green background and
                black text.. so i think it'll be funny to see</p>
