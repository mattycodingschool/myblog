            <h1>goodbyes</h1>
            <p>maybe i'm writing this because its the start of summer and those "goodbyes" are happening, but in the
                past few years i've really been thinking about these little goodbyes we have in our lives—a summer
                break, a friend graduating, a falling out of touch, a new doctor—some are filled with permanence when
                others aren't. and it's something i've really began to take notice of, this fact that there are teachers
                in my life, people from across the world (shoutout to the californians), students, who i (to put it
                blunt) will likely never see in person again.</p>
            <p>and i'm not sure the best way to deal with that, or how to properly say "goodbye". its difficult, and
                then theres this looming sense of "do i catch up?" which makes it even weirder because there's some
                people in my life who i've said goodbye to, but i don't know if i'll see them again. and it's just this
                paradoxal feeling</p>
            <p>i'm not too sure what i'm even getting at here, really just, its hard to say goodbye, and i don't know
                why it becomes more common every year. but i also think goodbyes can be beautiful, but i'm not sure how
                to "master" that (or if its even a good thing to be able to master goodbyes), its some untouchable
                animosity i guess.. but god do goodbyes hurt</p>

            <h5>short explanation</h5>
            <p>its been like two months since this happened, but there was a recent interaction with a teacher about
                bjork which was VERY very interesting, and also this just feels like a really nice capture of the
                feeling of "goodbye" to me (even though the song is not at all about goodbyes)</p>
