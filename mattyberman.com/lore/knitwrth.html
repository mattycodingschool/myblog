            <h1>knitwrth</h1>
            <p>ok this is not an advertisement but its something i have to write about. for context, i'm not into
                "streetwear" or much fashion at all (in terms of me personally buying or wearing it), but theres this
                one sweater company that has TOTALLY caught my eye, and i would totally buy all of their stuff (if it
                wasn't so expensive which is why i will be writing about the company instead of buying them..) but it is
                just SO cool to me and i have to share.</p>
            <p>so basically, its this company called "knitwrth" and they simply knit these really (sometimes) niche pop
                culture stuff? they have album cover sweaters, moments from movies, artworks, but something about it i
                just REALLY love, which is weird to me because i'm not into buying clothing at all (and i won't be)</p>
            <p>but if you happen to be somebody who is into all that, and needs a new company to buy (and maybe has
                extra money to spend on me!!) i'd suggest looking at this clothing brand, its so cool? #notsponsored</p>
            <p>here are some picks</p>

            <p>anyways i don't know why i've written a whole thing about this random company but i just found it very
                cool (and as you can tell from this post, i'm just very very bored but it's the summer so i will not
                complain!)... oh and also ignore how this website has like stretched every image oh well!</p>

            <p>i just feel like if they made a BRAT sweater (with the green album cover), it would be so iconic</p>
