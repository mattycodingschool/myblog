            <h1>triangle hearts</h1>
            <p>so, picture this. the eras tour movie just came out, i (idk why i did this in hindsight) chose to go with
                my sister, my friend matthew, and his friend</p>
            <p>now this was an interesting experience, i know some of taylor's songs, and it was cool hearing it in
                concert film, but oh my the swifties in my theater were silly</p>
            <p>the girl right in front of me kept taking out her phone and filming ME? like i'm not sure if that's a
                compliment or not but i kept trying to hide a little bit, but overall it was an interesting experience
            </p>
            <p>so the "triangle hearts" arrives near the end of the film, when the whole group i came with was taking
                photos in front of the little movie poster</p>
            <p>we're all doing hearts with our hands (you know, like whatever), until matthew pulls out this... i don't
                want to say heart because it isn't. let me show you</p>
