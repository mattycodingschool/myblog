            <h1>ethel cain - preacher's daughter [album]</h1>
            <p><i>disclaimer: im not sure if this is more lore or music so im going to put it in BOTH so sorry for the
                    repeat but i will be telling you the story about ethel cain</i></p>
            <p>preacher's daughter is a concept album about the life of ethel cain, im gonna go thru the songs and share
                a bit about her story, spoiler alert: it gets crazy. for each song, ill include a brief description and
                lyrical highlight</p>
            <h3>song 1: family tree (intro)</h3>
            <blockquote>jesus can always reject his father / but he cannot escape his mother's blood</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4fjSiuY9b3uBeGd1KBUNZE?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>so this first song really sets the scene for the album, we learn about ethel cain who grew up in shady
                grove, alabama in the 1990s. it establishes the strong religious themes of this album. the singer,
                hayden, herself had an extremely religious upbringing and this album connects a bit to that.</p>
            <h3>song 2: american teenager</h3>
            <blockquote>say what you want / but say it like you mean it / with your fists for once / a long cold war
                with your kids at the front / just give it one more day and you're done</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4ltqfN12ohaVZdM6C45gMg?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>a song so good obama (or one of his interns) put it on his year end list. this is the most accessible and
                conventional song of the album by far and i'd recommend it to anyone interested in her music. this
                doesn't add too much to the lore, but is a fantastic song</p>
            <h3>song 3: a house in nebraska</h3>
            <blockquote>and i found photographs of our school on the day we met / i thought that you were so beautiful,
                it was love, i guess</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6UxAKocZd98MRn0u5obryV?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>this is such a beautiful song about ethel's relationship with willoughby, her ex. it's a sad song that
                details the dream the two had to live together in this abandoned house in nebraska</p>
            <h3>song 4: western nights</h3>
            <blockquote>trouble's always gonna find you baby / but so will i</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0CMlcNJpLFaQxMTLFYpFdg?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>ethel's not with willoughby, but her new man logan. logan is not a good guy, at all. but ethel cannot
                escape her love for him. logan is also a criminal and has roped ethel into that lifestype</p>
            <h3>song 5: family tree</h3>
            <blockquote>take me down to the river and bathe me clean / put me on the back of your white horse to ride /
                all the way to the chapel, let you wash all over me</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5l79pLYX6NwTa6FiT8Eoyo?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>uh oh! logan the criminal has died in a police shootout :c, ethel is on the run (this is according to
                genius btw #citeyoursources), and ethel reflects on her family, a super similar song to track 1 (on
                purpose ofc)</p>
            <h3>song 6: hard times</h3>
            <blockquote>i was too young to notice / that some types of love could be bad</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7JPmhsHbjaDGmTCKBZxVVU?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>ethel reflects on her upbringing and her relationship with her father, a pastor. i'm not going to go too
                in depth on this blog but she talks about the incredibly troubled relationship the two had, but ethel
                doesn't like this story because she doesn't want to be a victim</p>
            <h3>song 7: thoroughfare</h3>
            <blockquote>you turned to me and stared into me deep / and said "well maybe not 'cause look at what i've got
                / you might not be my love, but baby, i doubt it"</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/04P1ylRDzyxBIl9W0UNWXC?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>the second act of the album begins! ethel has met a new man named isaiah, and they drive away and escape
                home together. ethel falls in love with isaiah. ethel's status as an unreliable narrator begins to
                blossom here. (more on that soon!)</p>
            <p>so we're gonna take a small pause here, and say that yay! ethel is falling in love and everythings going
                well. uh oh! it's not. news reports from ethel's home say she's been abducted, and ethel is telling us
                (the audience) a different story than the truth... what's gonna happen?</p>
            <h3>song 8: gibson girl</h3>
            <blockquote>and if it feels good / then it can't be bad</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/02yzNsWcv7BtITeIoIqeVU?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>in california (or wherever they are), isaiah has introduced ethel into a much darker life, one that is
                not the most appropriate for this blog. but isaiah has influenced ethel to use drugs and she is sadly
                starting to lose touch with reality</p>
            <p>we're taking another lore break! ethel has now woken up with hallucinations and has been lured by isaiah
                away. she's trapped.</p>
            <h3>song 9: ptolemaea</h3>
            <blockquote>even the iron still fears the rot / hiding from something i cannot stop / walking on shadows, i
                can't lead him back</blockquote>
            <blockquote>make it stop</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/29LsI5izZL8txZEJhegSBs?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>isaiah has trapped ethel, she tries to escape but cannot, there is a shocking part of this song which i
                won't spoil because you should listen to this song and skip to the 3 minute mark and wait for the "make
                it stop" line to happen because it WILL shock you. but ethel is in a terrible place right now.</p>
            <h3>song 10: august underground</h3>
            <blockquote>*gunshot*</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3JuoY84eCBqfDPb0Caggcg?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>in the first of two instrumental songs, ethel is locked away with isaiah, he's revealed his true nature
                (at the end of ptolemaea) and ethel has accepted her fate. :c</p>
            <h3>song 11: televangelism</h3>
            <blockquote>*ascending to heaven*</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6jd7Cv7yfWGTs7g89eA9Ss?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>the second instrumental is a piano song which apparently ethel did in ONE TAKE which i find incredibly
                hard to believe because this song is amazing. it's ethereal. it's beautiful. it makes me feel like i'm
                ascending to heaven. but sadly, that IS what is actually happening to ethel. near the end of the song,
                it fades away like a broken record, reminding us of ethel's situation.</p>
            <p>lore break again! so sadly ethel has died. but the last two songs are amazing so keep reading, hope
                you're doing well!</p>
            <h3>song 12: sun bleached flies</h3>
            <blockquote>god loves you / but not enough to save you</blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6fKIyDJHZ9m84jRhSmpuwS?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>my favourite song on this album by far, it's just incredible. ethel talks about her upbringing, her life,
                and really just reflects. words do not do this song justice, it's so beautiful and a song i constantly
                finding myself listening to when i'm feeling down</p>
            <h3>song 13: strangers</h3>
            <blockquote>when my mother sees me on the side / of a milk carton in winn-dixie's dairy aisle / she'll cry
                and wait up for me </blockquote>
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px"
                src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5Cc0Pe8p7c2OJxMj07ywvc?utm_source=generator" width="100%"
                height="100" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen=""
                allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
                loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>another beautiful song, this is ethel's goodbye to the world and to her family. isaiah has continued to
                be weird (again, this is a family blog so maybe listen to the song to find out). this is such a
                beautiful ending to the album and this and sun bleached flies really work to end ethel's journey</p>
            <p>so this album is fantastic and i hope i've convinced you to listen! now its a pretty long album so if
                you're gonna listen to some songs i'd suggest american teenager and sun bleached flies, but also the
                instrumental televangelism (esp past the first minute) is so beautiful. @indigo i really hope you learn
                it on piano one day (please)</p>
