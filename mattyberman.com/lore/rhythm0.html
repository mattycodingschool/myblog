            <p>ok so i know this isnt pop culture related but i stumbled upon this i wanna say last summer and i just
                kept reading and this was so interesting to me? so to start, there's this art form, called endurance
                art, which is basically performance art where the artist subjects themselves to some kind of pain (which
                ISNT GOOD), but it reveals a lot about humanity</p>
            <p>so in the 1970s, this artist named marina abramović did this piece of performance art where she basically
                stood still for 6 hours straight in front of a table with 72 objects ranging from flowers to food to a
                gun and a bullet, etcetera</p>
            <p>now what's crazy to me is that she did this in a public area so anyone could walk up and interact with
                her, which they did. it started off somewhat tame but as the performance went on, marina (who again
                would not move or respond to anything being done) was subjected to a lot of violence - which again is
                crazy just because of how many people were watching</p>
            <p>abramović objectified herself to the audience, for 6 hours her life
                was at the will of random streetgoers, but the fact that it went that far, to the point where somebody
                held a gun to her head, is crazy</p>
            <p>i feel like this reveals so much about human nature because it shows what we will do when there are no
                consequences, she had a note saying "during this period i take full responsibility", basically telling
                the audience that she would allow them to do whatever</p>
            <p>when the six hours ended, she broke her stance and simply walked out, causing the audience to run away to
                avoid a potential conflict</p>
            <p>this is an insane piece that i hope (if you're interested) you'll look more into because this is just a
                crazy reflection of us</p>
