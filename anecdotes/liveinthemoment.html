            <h1>making the most of a good experience</h1>
            <p>i was on a call with a friend a few months ago and she spoke to me about knowing when you're in the best
                place you can be, really it was about how we as humans so often love to look down on anything (i do this
                all the time), eg: a test went well but after you worry about every question, a conversation went well
                but you then worry about every interaction, etc</p>
            <p>and she told me something a friend told her which i guess i'm now telling you (that felt like a really
                confusing sentence), but it's that, if in the moment, you feel like it went right, then don't dwell on
                it and turn something you loved into something you hate</p>
            <p>so to make the most of a good experience, let yourself exist in the present. why would something that you
                felt amazing about at one second now be terrible looking back at it. don't do that to yourself, make the
                most of your experiences
