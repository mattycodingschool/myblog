            <h1>20 moments</h1>
            <p>last year i had a teacher who would have the most in depth moments with the class, it was a super
                exciting place to be in. one thing they told us that i still haven't forgot (and has become increasingly
                relevant to me recently) was about how we as humans have around 20 good "moments" in life</p>
            <p>like those moments where you're with your family at the perfect sunset and the air outside of you matches
                the air inside and you just feel so peaceful</p>
            <p>when she said that originally i tried to think if i had any of those moments yet - i think i did i just
                may have forgotten, but i had one of those moments around two months ago and it still makes me feel joy
            </p>
            <p>so keep finding those moments!!</p>
            <p><i>also sorry for being so intentionally vague about my moment if you want to ask me it irl please feel
                    free!</i></p>
