            <p>ok, shoutout to randy for requesting i talk about this (which has motivated me to continue writing some
                stuff)... but who is harry daniels? well, he's a tiktokker/influencer (ugh) who has seemingly gained a
                fanbase for going up to random celebrities and singing to them. he sang <i>skyscraper</i> to demi
                lovato, that money money money song to jessie j (but like her airpod sounding version iykyk), he sang
                <i>NATIONAL ANTHEM</i> by LANA DEL REY to the president of the united states, joe biden. like?
            </p>

            <p>anyways, something about him just feels very comedic to me, i have a few friends who i will consistently
                share his videos to and he is just an incredibly funny individual (i just remembered he dressed up as a
                witch? and sang to abby lee miller???), if you have any free time, i'd suggest scrolling through his
                page it is a huge rabbit hole but actually makes me tear up laughing</p>
            <p>so my... interesting self, inspired by harry daniels, wanted to do something similar. so, i went up to
                random, COSSOT!! people, and sang some songs. i sang roar to the havergal? mascot (10/10 fire
                performance btw), karma by jojo siwa to.. idek who, and so much more! shoutout to timothy for really
                giving me the self confidence for this</p>
            <p>anyways it was a great time and i'm excited to keep singing (not rly). social anxiety has nothing on me
